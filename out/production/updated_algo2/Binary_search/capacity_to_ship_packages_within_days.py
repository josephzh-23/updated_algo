Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
output : 15 as said

# may not load more than the max weight capacity here
 want to find the minimum capacity to ship all things
Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Steps:
1. ans to store the resultant min capacity of the boat required, -1

2. Initialize two variables, say s and e with the maximum element in the given array
and the total sum of the array respectively which denotes the lower
 and upper bounds of the search space.

 3. mid = (s + e) /2
 Check if it is possible to ship all the packages within D days when the maximum
 capacity allowed is mid.
    - If found to be true, then update the value of ans to mid and the value of e to (mid â€“ 1).
    - Otherwise, update the value of s to (mid + 1).
