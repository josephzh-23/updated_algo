All TC : O(1)

AND (&):
X & Y → This keeps the bits that are set for both X and Y.

If differnt bit-> then becomes 0
if same bit -> then 1

XOR (^):
X^Y → This checks if a position has a set bit in either one of X or Y,
if there is then the result also has a set bit there. Eg.

If both are same then becomes 0
if both are different then becomes 1
X = 1011010
Y = 0101010
------------------
X^Y = 1110000

When you have 0 ^ 2 then becomes = 2

OR (|):
X | Y → This keeps all the bits that are set either in X or in Y.

NOT (~):
~X → This inverts all the bits present in the binary representation of X.
